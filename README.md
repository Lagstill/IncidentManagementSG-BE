## 1. Introduction

Our backend system includes a self-healing incident documentation process that ensures prompt identification, response, and mitigation of incidents while maintaining comprehensive incident records.

## 2. Workflow Overview

Our self-healing incident documentation system involves the following components:

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates the deployment process triggered by pushes to specific branches.
- **Docker Hub:** Stores Docker images of our backend application.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines ensure a smooth deployment process.
- **Azure App Service:** Hosts our backend application.
- **Incident Management Logic:** Embedded logic for detecting and responding to incidents.

## 3. Technologies Used

- GitHub Actions
- Docker Hub
- CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., Azure DevOps)
- Azure App Service
- Backend Technology Stack (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Incident Management Tools (e.g., incident detection scripts, alerting mechanisms)
